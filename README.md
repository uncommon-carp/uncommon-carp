Hello! I'm Cory. I'm a software developer currently working in the IoT space with TypeScript and  GraphQL. I am currently pursuing the AWS Solutions Architect Certification. Formerly a large format graphics professional, I decided to make the leap into development to make better use of my time and skills.

Here you'll find my hobby projects. 

Outside of coding, I'm an avid fly fisher and gamer. Find me chasing carp around Austin, TX or blasting in Overwatch.
